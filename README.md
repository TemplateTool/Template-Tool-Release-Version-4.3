Template Tool Release Version 4.3
The Template Tool (TT) is a Java-based software. TT is a fully functional application that facilitates communication, collaboration, requirements traceability, and rapid mock-up prototyping from the point of conception and requirements gathering, to development, testing, and implementation. With the use of drag-and-drop and push-button selections without having to write any code, TT allows end users to add field components, skip-logic, business rules, any number of nested conditional statements in the form of if/then and else-if statements, as well as to simulate workflow.

TT saves the project files as EXtensible Markup Language (XML), and the various produced products export into HyperText Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript jQuery, Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF), and Microsoft Word. A short (less than 5 minutes) YouTube video proposition for why an organization might need to use the software is posted here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9SJmoM30aE. A 90-second YouTube video for one of the features of TT is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK5wyOaxqUI.
